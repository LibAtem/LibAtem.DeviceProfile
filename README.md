# LibAtem.DeviceProfile

This is a helper library for working with the varying device topology of the Blackmagic Design ATEM mixers. 
It is an optional helper for LibAtem, that can either build a profile of the device, or load one from file and check whether certain features or sources are available at runtime.

It is written for .Net Core 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and Linux

Note: this is not yet complete, but existing functionality is stable and unlikely to undergo massive changes.

### Device support
This is known to work well with ATEM firmware 7.2, and is likely to work with others.
